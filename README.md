### Data Analytics Bootcamp - PyCitySchools Project Summary

### Background
You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

### 4. Actionable Insights
#### **Student Performance**
- **Math Scores Need Improvement:**
  - With a pass rate of 74.98%, math requires targeted support. Resources like focused tutoring and additional practice tools can bridge gaps.
- **Strength in Reading:**
  - High reading pass rates (85.81%) suggest effective teaching strategies that could inform approaches to math instruction.

#### **Budget Utilization**
- **Relationship Between Spending and Performance:**
  - Schools with higher per-student budgets achieve better outcomes. Consider analyzing spending distribution to identify underfunded areas.

#### **Performance by School Type**
- Charter schools outperform district schools in both reading and math scores. Exploring charter school methodologies could yield replicable success strategies.

#### **Grade-Level Trends**
- Performance varies by grade, suggesting that certain grades may need specific interventions, such as additional resources for transitional years (e.g., 9th grade).
